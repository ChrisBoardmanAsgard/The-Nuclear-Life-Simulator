missing developer information {}
some of the menu buttons are not as responsive as i would've liked {}
the generation counter is broken {} 
the simulation buttons and world stats appear in the main menu when they should only appear in the main simulation and preset sim {}
the empty world preset is missing and needs a button to get to that from the main menu screen {}
overhaul the reproduction and put a hard  cap limit {}
overhaul the neural net and the neural net should be determined by the creatures genes and should be passed down and evolve over time {}
add a settings button at the mainscreen which would give the ability for the user to adjust resolution and volume, along side with keymapping. 
The control map button either doesn't work or doesn't display the right info when i click on it {} 
display the current version number at the main menu screen {}
